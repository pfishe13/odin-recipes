    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h2>Wings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds chicken wings, tips discarded</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 stalk green onion, diced</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray basket with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken wings dry with a paper towel. Whisk together baking powder, salt, pepper, and paprika; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Place some of the chicken wings into the bag and give it a good shake until wings are well coated. Shake off excess baking powder mixture and repeat with remaining wings until all wings are coated.</li>
        <li>Place chicken wings in the air fryer basket, and cook, flipping halfway through, 22 to 23 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine vinegar, pineapple juice, ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, Sriracha, and sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir well and bring to a boil. Boil for about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to a simmer. Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl, pour into the saucepan, and quickly whisk until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. If sauce is too thick, thin out with a little water.</li>
        <li>Increase air fryer temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and cook wings until cooked through and crispy brown, about 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce into a large bowl and add the cooked wings. Toss to coat well. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onion and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
